          The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day
          of the week they were born and the order in which they were born.
          These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and
          character of the person. Middle names have considerably more variety
          and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's
          middle name.

          This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates
          the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender
          it outputs their Akan Name.
