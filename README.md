# Akan-Names

<table>
<tr>
<td>
The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day
of the week they were born and the order in which they were born.
These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and
character of the person. Middle names have considerably more variety
and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's
middle name.
